        <h1>⚠️ WARNING: Raazi - What You Need to Know</h1>
        <p>Raazi is a familiar name among students and young adults in his community, but not for the right reasons. Over time, multiple individuals have come forward describing unsettling encounters with him, raising serious concerns about his behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>Anonymous Testimonies</h2>
        <div class="testimony">
            <p><strong>"The Unwanted DMs"</strong></p>
            <p>"At first, he seemed normal—just messaging occasionally. But when I didn’t respond right away, he would send multiple follow-ups, sometimes getting angry or guilt-tripping me. I started feeling like I couldn’t ignore him without consequences."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="testimony">
            <p><strong>"The Uncomfortable Encounters"</strong></p>
            <p>"He always found an excuse to touch me—whether it was grabbing my wrist to ‘get my attention’ or standing too close. It made me uncomfortable, but when I told him to stop, he just laughed it off like it was nothing."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Exclusive Interviews</h2>
        <div class="interview">
            <p><strong>"He Made Me Feel Trapped"</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "At first, I thought he was just overly friendly, always finding a reason to be close. But then I noticed—he was different when no one else was around."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you describe one of those encounters?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "One afternoon, I was alone in the art room, packing up my things. The door was open, but the room was empty. Suddenly, I felt him behind me—too close. His hand brushed against my side and lingered. ‘You always smell so nice,’ he whispered. I froze. He leaned in just enough that I could feel his breath. ‘So fresh… so different.’ My stomach turned. I forced a laugh and stepped away, but he caught my wrist, holding it lightly. ‘Don’t leave so soon,’ he said, his voice almost playful, but I could feel the pressure in his grip."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Did he ever physically stop you from leaving?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "Yes. There were times when he’d block the doorway, just standing there, looking me up and down. ‘You’re always in such a rush,’ he’d murmur. ‘What’s the hurry?’ It felt like a game to him, testing how much he could do before I reacted."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How did this affect you?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "I started avoiding empty rooms, quiet hallways, anywhere he could catch me alone. But even in crowded spaces, I never felt at ease. He’d brush his fingers along my back as he passed or whisper, ‘I missed you,’ like we had some kind of secret. It made my skin crawl."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="interview">
            <p><strong>"The Boundary Pusher"</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "He had this way of touching you just enough to make you question if it was on purpose. And if you pulled away, he’d just laugh."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What kind of behavior did you experience?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "His hands were always somewhere—on my lower back, trailing across my knee, fingers brushing my arm like it was an accident. But it wasn’t. I knew it wasn’t."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Can you give an example?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "Once in the library, we were sitting close, looking at something on his phone. He leaned in like he was going to tell me something, but instead, he whispered, ‘I bet you taste as good as you smell.’ I pulled away, but he just smirked. ‘So sensitive,’ he murmured, like it was a compliment."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Did you ever try to stop him?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "I told him to stop touching me, but he just tilted his head and smiled. ‘But you don’t really mind, do you?’ he said, like it was a fact. He made me second-guess myself, like maybe I was overreacting. But I wasn’t. And I wasn’t the only one."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview">
            <p><strong>"He Didn’t Care Who You Were"</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "People assumed he only acted like this with girls, but that wasn’t true. He didn’t care who you were—if he wanted to cross a line, he would."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "He was just as physical with guys, but in a way that didn’t seem obvious. His hand on my shoulder during class, fingers grazing my neck when he walked by, standing too close in the locker room, always brushing against me when no one was looking."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Did he ever take it further?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "One time after gym, I was the last one in the locker room. He came up behind me, put his hands on my shoulders, and whispered, ‘You’re always so tense.’ His thumbs pressed into my back, and before I could move, he leaned in. ‘Relax. No need to be so shy.’ I shoved his hands off, but he just chuckled. ‘You’ll come around,’ he said like it was inevitable."</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Did anyone else notice?</p>
            <p><strong>Victim:</strong> "Not really. He knew exactly when to do it—when no one else was watching. And if you reacted, he’d make a joke out of it. If you confronted him, he’d act hurt, like you were imagining things. But I know what I felt. And I know I wasn’t alone."</p>

        <h2>How to Stay Safe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If something feels off, it probably is.</li>
            <li><strong>Set firm boundaries:</strong> You do not owe anyone your time, attention, or personal space.</li>
            <li><strong>Block and report:</strong> If he is persistent online, use platform tools to block and report his behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Speak up:</strong> If you feel comfortable, share your experience with someone you trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Support others:</strong> If someone confides in you, listen and validate their experience.</li>
        </ul>
